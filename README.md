Name: Trung Lai

Account Desc: This is my personal account that I will use for Wake Tech-related GitHub projects, including the current one for CTI-110.

Repo Desc: This is a small repository(henceforth 'repo') that was made for a lab assignment in CTI-110. All it contains currently is a README.md file containing my personal info (my name) that will be released to the public.

Steps Desc: The steps I took to make this repo were fairly simple. First I created my account and created the repo. Then I cloned the repo from GitHub desktop (already downloaded) using the "Add" dropdown menu. Finally, after selecting a file path, I cloned whatever was in my newly-created repo at the sime which was an empty README.md file.
